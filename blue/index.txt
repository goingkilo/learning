a word on assignment and exploratory papers

Assignment papers are used to capture succint and relevant information about a technology, process or event.
I aim to write a lot of these . They would need to work as prep-notes as well as 'gist-of-the-matter' notes to refer to.
for eg, a paper on terraform should  aim to exhaustively cover the behaviour of the tool, as well as scenarios where 
they apply, and how they are used. A paper on development /deploy process might cover sequence of events  which happen typically,
 and benefits and shortcomings, with perspective on how things happen elsewhere.
 One benefit to tap here is that reading and summarising, in two steps respectively, is a powerful concentration and 
 memory exercise.

Exploratory papers aim to discover new things out of existing information. These can be scientific ,behavioural or 
just conceptual.
